# FIFA21 Data Analysis
At first, this was just going to be a project to practice my data cleaning skills, but after finishing the cleaning part, I decided to go
further. Now I want to go even deeper and perform some analysis on this (now clean) dataset.

By the way, this project ideia was from a Youtuber called 'Data With Mo', [link to his video](https://youtu.be/wObV_hwu2QM?t=431).

And the data was extracted from Kaggle, [link to the raw dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring))

I did the data cleaning in a single Jupyter Notebook, and now I'm going to make the analysis in another one, just to let things separated
